#Introduction to GIT
## Introduction
In the age of programmability, git and github becomes an awesome resource for version control.   While the normal use for both of these tools is for software development, there is a great number of other uses as well.

In this tutorial, I'm going to provide a overview of a git workflow that is very useful for multiple people working on a single project.   There is really alot of documentation on git, but sometimes it is a bit difficult to find everything that you need.  Hopefully, this workflow will help.  

I would really like to thank the following people since I borrowed some ideas and text from them and made this a bit more concise:

* Aditya Sridhar ([https://adityasridhar.com/)]() - Aditya Sridhar wrote the original tutorial that I used to build off of.  It is a great tutorial and I wanted to add more detail to it.

## What is git and github anyway?
These are two very closely related tools that serve as a great solution for source control.

### git
git is opensource revision control system that allows you to manage your source code history.  git is free to download and install and a great solution for anyone wanting a simple and easy to use method.

git is provided via several methods.

* OSX - git is provided by the Mac OSX package called XCode.  most OSX installations do not have XCode installed by default.   Therefore you can install it via the App Store.
* Windows - git is provided free of charge at the following link [https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git](). Once you download and install it, you will be able to leverage git on Windows.

###github
github is a hosting service for git repositories.  There are multiple providers of repositiories that work with git.   However, git is really used by alot of people.

Installation can also be a on-premise repositories.   This is useful for customers that would like to maintain their own repositories. Obviously corporations down want to publish their proprietary source code in the public.  However, the public github is used by millions so users can share and work on each others source code.

All of the examples, in this tutorial will be done on mac OSX.   However, they should also work with Windows with minor changes.   In addition, although we are showing examples using github, any hosting service that supports git will be supported.
